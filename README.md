Features of the site.
- Only the administrator, the first user created in the database, has the rights to create and edit posts, delete comments.
- All registered users can leave comments under posts.
- Unregistered users can only view posts without being able to comment.

Peculiar properties.
- To register and test the site, you can use any email, even non-existent (for example, user@mail.com).
- To get administrator rights and create or edit posts, use: (login admin@mail.ru, password 12345). Please don't delete existing posts.
- To load an image into the form when creating a post, use the image address.
- The Lorem Ipsum resource was used as the text in the posts. It is only a fictional text of the printing and typesetting industry.
